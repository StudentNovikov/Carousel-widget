# Carousel-widget
Description:
We need a carousel widget to have the ability to demonstrate a set of products to customers, give them ability to look through all products in set, both at desktop and mobile devices.

AC:
  - Widget should be able to work in X or Y dimensions.
  - Widget should be able to initialize with passed objects (pictureUrl, title, description) or could be applied on exact           markup container.
  - Widget should work well both on touch screens and with pointers.
  - Widget should have side arrow buttons for pointer interaction as well.
  - Widget should be configurable:
  - Count of visible/active items
  - Speed of scroll
  - Count of scrollable items per arrow click
  - Infinitive scroll
  - Direction of scroll ( x / y )
  - All items, outside of the ‘active’ zone and still visible - should be partially opaque.
  - We should have the ability to use multiple widgets on the same page.
